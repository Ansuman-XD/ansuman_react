// TODO:Question-2:
// Write a JavaScript program that calculates the final price of a product after applying a discount. The program should:

// Define a variable originalPrice to store the original price of the product.
// Define another variable discount to store the discount amount.
// Calculate the final price by subtracting the discount from the original price.
// Display the discounted price using console.log.
let original= 100;
let discount=20;
let final= original-discount;
console.log("the discount price is", final);
